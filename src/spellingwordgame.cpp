 *
 *      This game is intended for use with a child's spelling
 *      word list. It takes a spelling word list and, after
 *      sorting by alphabetical order, picks a random word
 *      which the player tries to guess. The player is given
 *      an indication of whether the word they guessed is
 *      higher or lower in the alphabetical order than the
 *      target word. Then the player gets to guess again.
